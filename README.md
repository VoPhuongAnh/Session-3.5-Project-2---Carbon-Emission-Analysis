Swiss Code Course - Practice Session 3.5:

## A - Project's objective (3-5 lines)
During the past few decades, we as human being can forseee the significant effect of climate change. One of the reasons contriubting to the changes is carbon emission from human being's daily and industrial production activities. 
This project is acting as a small analization on carbon emissions which mainly examines the carbon footprint across various industries; and Through this analysis, we hope to gain an understanding of the environmental impact of different industries and contribute to making informed decisions in sustainable development.

How to do project : 
Our dataset is compiled from publicly available data from nature.com and encompasses the product carbon footprints (PCF) for various companies. PCFs represent the greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific products, quantified in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).
